Config is the main system that parses out the configuration file to set up
the other classes.

TcpListener listens for connections, accepts them. Can't do anything with them
yet. We have to pass it to an Acceptor of some sort.

HttpAcceptor, SpdyAcceptor -> takes a connection and handles its lifecycle,
   which means taking raw bytes and pulling requests out of them.

Service -> reads in HTTP requests and returns responses, using pools etc.

....

Pool manages creating backends when it has no more. It tries to keep a queue
of them. There's a worker inside that just creates backends. Only one backend
can be in Connecting state at a time.

Service receives requests and puts them into a channel. A goroutine on Service
reads requests and then backends and matches them up. This triggers the Pool
goroutine to make more backends.
